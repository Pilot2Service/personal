## Introduction  

I have always been fascinated by how new ideas become real businesses â€“ how something abstract can be shaped into a product, a service, or even a whole new venture. That fascination has guided me for more than 15 years in consulting, entrepreneurship, and international innovation leadership.  

**What I can deliver today is a unique blend:** deep commercialization experience, practical business design skills, and the ability to prototype with AI.

## Professional Journey  

- **400+ projects in commercialization and service design**  
  Worked with startups, research groups, and established firms to help them move from concept to market.  

- **Consulting & Entrepreneurship**  
  Began my career in one of Finlandâ€™s largest consulting firms, before founding and running my own international commercialization office for nearly a decade. This offered a privileged view into how growth companies scaleâ€”or struggle with productâ€“market fitâ€”and how design execution turns vision into reality.  

- **Demola Global**  
  Served seven years as Vice President and ten years on the board, including as Chair in 2024. Together we built Demola into a **European benchmark for industryâ€“academia collaboration**, delivering innovation programs across Europe, Africa, China, and Japan. Over **50,000 students from 180 countries** applied to our platform.  
  - Led platformisation, service design, and international program architecture.  
  - Coached hundreds of university-driven innovation projects.  
  - Invited by the **European Commission** to author a [policy report][1] on innovation co-creation.  

- **Entrepreneurship & Advisory Roles**  
  - Board member of [Quha Oy][2], a high-technology company with a global niche in assistive devices.  
  - Co-owner of [Shen Garden][3], a yoga & pilates studio in Tampere.  
  - Creator of the [Pilot2Service framework][4], books, and material library for research teams and pilot project owners.

## Current Focus  

The next wave in business design will be shaped by **AI**. Its role is not to replace expertise, but to strengthen itâ€”especially in **growth simulation, scenario analysis, and rapid prototyping**.  

I have built a portfolio of early experiments and proof-of-concepts to explore how these tools can be applied in practice.

## What I Bring  

- **Commercialization expertise** â€“ proven ability to design viable business models, productize services, and guide clients through new business venturing.  
- **Innovation leadership** â€“ international experience in venture building, startup acceleration, and co-creation with industry leaders.  
- **Business prototyping** â€“ hands-on skills in building MVPs with vibe coding and AI tools, enabling rapid testing, scenario building, and iteration.  
- **Client impact** â€“ a pragmatic approach that simplifies complexity and delivers outcomes that inspire trust and support decision-making.

## Personal Note  

I am married and a father of two teenage boys. Outside work I am active in the street art community, creating stencil works under the artist name [**T137**][5] and spotting street art wherever I travel â€“ from Berlin to the West Bank, Palestine.  

I am especially motivated by roles where I can act as a senior expertâ€”**Business Designer, Venture Architect, or Innovation Lead**â€”working with multiple clients and projects.  
ðŸ‘‰ Depending on your needs, I am open to both **full-time roles** and **flexible freelancer engagements**.
